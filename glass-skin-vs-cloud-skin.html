        <p>Two major skin trends are dominating right now, and they couldn't be more different. On one side, we have glass skin-that ultra-reflective, mirror-like finish that originated in Korea. On the other, cloud skin-the soft, diffused, almost airbrushed look that's been all over TikTok. Both are gorgeous, both are achievable, but they're definitely not the same thing.</p>

        <p>So which one is your vibe? Let's break down everything you need to know about both trends, how to achieve them, and most importantly, which one actually works for your skin type and lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>Glass Skin: The Ultra-Glossy Look</h2>

        <p>Glass skin is exactly what it sounds like-skin so smooth, clear, and luminous that it looks like glass. Think of it as the maximum level of dewiness. This Korean beauty trend is all about creating a reflective, almost wet-looking finish that catches light from every angle.</p>

        <h3>The Glass Skin Aesthetic</h3>

        <p>This look is unapologetically shiny. Your skin should look like you just applied the most incredible serum and it's still glistening on your face. It's fresh, it's hydrated, and it's definitely high-maintenance gorgeous. Glass skin works best for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Editorial shoots and special occasions</li>
            <li>Indoor events with good lighting</li>
            <li>When you want maximum impact</li>
            <li>Cool weather when your skin won't get too oily</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Achieve Glass Skin</h3>

        <p>Glass skin isn't just about makeup-it's 80% skincare. Here's the full breakdown:</p>

        <h3>The Skincare Foundation</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Double cleanse religiously:</strong> You need a completely clean canvas. Oil cleanser first, then a gentle foam or gel cleanser.</li>
            <li><strong>Exfoliate regularly:</strong> Chemical exfoliation with AHAs or BHAs 2-3 times per week creates that smooth surface. Dead skin cells are the enemy of glass skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer hydration:</strong> This is where the K-beauty 7-skin method shines. Apply a hydrating toner in multiple thin layers until your skin is practically glowing.</li>
            <li><strong>Use essences and serums:</strong> Hyaluronic acid is your best friend. Layer a hydrating essence, then a brightening serum (vitamin C or niacinamide).</li>
            <li><strong>Lock it in:</strong> A lightweight but nourishing moisturizer seals everything in without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li><strong>Face oil is essential:</strong> This is what gives you that final glossy finish. 2-3 drops of squalane, rosehip, or marula oil pressed into the skin.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Makeup for Glass Skin</h3>

        <p>Once your skincare is doing the heavy lifting, makeup is just about enhancing that glow:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Illuminating primer:</strong> Mix it with your moisturizer or apply it to high points of your face.</li>
            <li><strong>Lightweight base:</strong> Tinted moisturizer or skin tint works better than full coverage foundation. You want your skin to show through.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquid highlighter:</strong> Mix a drop into your foundation for all-over luminosity, or apply to cheekbones, bridge of nose, and cupid's bow.</li>
            <li><strong>Cream products only:</strong> Powder is the enemy of glass skin. Use cream blush, cream bronzer, everything cream.</li>
            <li><strong>Face mist:</strong> Finish with a hydrating mist to meld everything together and boost that dewy finish.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Glass Skin Reality Check:</h4>
            <p>Let's be real-glass skin can slide into just looking oily, especially if you have naturally oily skin or it's humid out. This look requires touch-ups and works best for shorter wear times. It's gorgeous for the 'gram, but maybe not your everyday if you're in class for 8 hours.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Cloud Skin: The Soft-Focus Dream</h2>

        <p>Cloud skin is the softer, more forgiving cousin of glass skin. Instead of shine and reflection, you're going for a soft, diffused, almost blurred finish. Think of how your skin looks through a soft-focus filter-smooth, even, and naturally flawless without obvious shine or texture.</p>

        <h3>The Cloud Skin Aesthetic</h3>

        <p>This trend is all about creating skin that looks like a cloud-soft, airy, and ethereal. It's more matte than glass skin but not flat or cakey. There's still dimension and life to the skin, just in a more subtle way. Cloud skin is perfect for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Everyday wear, including long school days</li>
            <li>Humid weather or if you have oily skin</li>
            <li>When you want to look polished but effortless</li>
            <li>Situations where you need your makeup to last hours without touch-ups</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Achieve Cloud Skin</h3>

        <p>Cloud skin is more about technique than products. Here's how to get that soft, dreamy finish:</p>

        <h3>The Skincare Base</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Focus on texture:</strong> Cloud skin needs smooth, even texture. Use gentle chemical exfoliants and niacinamide to refine pores.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrate, but don't drench:</strong> You want your skin hydrated enough to be plump and healthy, but not so much that it's shiny. Gel moisturizers work great here.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a pore-blurring primer:</strong> This is key for cloud skin. Silicone-based primers fill in pores and fine lines for that airbrushed effect.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance is everything:</strong> If you're oily, use mattifying products in your T-zone but keep the rest of your face hydrated.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Makeup for Cloud Skin</h3>

        <p>Cloud skin makeup is all about strategic product placement and blending:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Skin-like foundation:</strong> Medium coverage foundation with a natural-to-satin finish. Nothing too matte, nothing too dewy.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic powder:</strong> Use a finely-milled setting powder only where you need it-usually T-zone and under eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cream products on the perimeter:</strong> Use cream blush and bronzer on the outer parts of your face for dimension, but set your T-zone with powder.</li>
            <li><strong>Soft, diffused highlight:</strong> Instead of a wet-look highlight, use a powder highlighter with a fan brush for a soft sheen. Or skip it entirely.</li>
            <li><strong>Setting spray is your friend:</strong> Use a matte or natural finish setting spray to meld everything together and eliminate any powdery texture.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>The Cloud Skin Secret:</h4>
            <p>The real secret to cloud skin is in your tools. A damp beauty sponge is essential-it presses products into your skin instead of sitting on top, creating that soft-focus effect. Bounce your sponge over your entire face after applying products to blur everything together.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Which Trend is Right for You?</h2>

        <p>Here's the real talk on who should choose what:</p>

        <h3>Choose Glass Skin If:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>You have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li>You don't mind touch-ups throughout the day</li>
            <li>You're going to an event or want a high-impact look</li>
            <li>You love that fresh, just-did-my-skincare glow</li>
            <li>You're willing to invest time in an extensive skincare routine</li>
            <li>You live in a cooler, drier climate</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Choose Cloud Skin If:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>You have oily or combination skin</li>
            <li>You need your makeup to last all day</li>
            <li>You prefer a more subtle, natural look</li>
            <li>You live somewhere humid</li>
            <li>You want something lower maintenance</li>
            <li>You have visible pores or texture you want to minimize</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Can You Do Both?</h2>

        <p>Absolutely. In fact, combining elements of both trends is probably the most wearable approach. Here's how to hybrid it:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Do cloud skin on your T-zone and glass skin on your cheeks</li>
            <li>Create a glass skin base with skincare, then use cloud skin makeup techniques</li>
            <li>Switch between trends based on the season-glass skin in fall/winter, cloud skin in spring/summer</li>
            <li>Use glass skin for nights out and cloud skin for everyday</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Products That Work for Both</h2>

        <p>Some products are versatile enough to work for either trend, depending on how you use them:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid serum:</strong> Essential for glass skin, also provides the hydration needed for cloud skin to not look flat</li>
            <li><strong>Skin tint or light foundation:</strong> Can be layered and mixed with oils for glass skin, or set with powder for cloud skin</li>
            <li><strong>Cream blush:</strong> Works for both trends-just use more for glass skin, less for cloud skin</li>
            <li><strong>Beauty sponge:</strong> Creates glass skin when used damp with no powder, creates cloud skin when used to blend powder products</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>Neither trend is objectively better-they're just different aesthetics for different vibes. Glass skin is bold, high-impact, and undeniably gorgeous but requires more maintenance. Cloud skin is softer, more practical, and works for more skin types and situations.</p>

        <p>The best approach? Master both and switch between them based on your mood, the occasion, and what your skin is doing that day. Your skin doesn't have to fit into one aesthetic box. That's the beauty of makeup and skincare-you get to decide your vibe every single day.</p>

        <p>Start with whichever one sounds more appealing to you, practice the techniques, figure out which products work for your skin, and then experiment with the other. By the time you're comfortable with both, you'll have a complete understanding of how to manipulate finish, texture, and glow to create literally any skin look you want.</p>
